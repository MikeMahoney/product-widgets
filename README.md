## Notes

- I went with the React framework as it is what I'm currently most comfortable using
- I chose SASS for styling over styled-components as I wanted to show off more traditional css structures
- Given more time I would have added Jest test cases: Check app renders, check only 1 linked profile, check toggle and color switchers work as expected, check hover and selected styles
- The custom tooltip would ideally been fleshed out more and have more options for use. I went with a custom tooltip to show off some more JS code, e.g. events and timeouts. For an enterprise product react-tooltip ir MaterialUI tooltip might be the better option
